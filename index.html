      </google-chart> --> </div> </div> <div class=article> <section class=intro> <p> Adele’s new single Hello has been blazing away to new records on music streaming services’. And just as quickly it has been accused of being lyrically similar to Tom Waits’ Martha. </p> <p>We decided to take a closer look at the two songs to see if this accusation packs any punch. </p> </section> <section class=number_comparison> <h1>By the numbers</h1> <img class=center-block src=./images/number_comparison.b301f35e.png> <p>As is apparent by reading them Tom Waits’ lyrics are a bit shorter than Adele’s. Adele repeats the chorus quite a few times with slight variations and thus overall it seems to be longer. </p> <p> But the number of unique words used by both of them is almost the same (118 vs 117). The number of unique words common to both the songs is 65, which shows that the vocabulary used is different. </p> <img class=center-block src=./images/word_frequency_comparison.f2dc26d5.png> </section> <section class=thematic_comparison> <h1>What's on their mind ?</h1> <p>To compare the context for the usage of the same word in both the songs we can use a <a href=https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/wordtree>word tree</a>.</p> <img class=center-block src=./images/word_tree_1.0f45664c.png> <h2>'you'</h2> <img class=center-block src=./images/word_trees/ad_tree_you.4127cbb6.png> <img class=center-block src=./images/word_trees/tw_tree_you.def188bb.png> <p>We can clearly see a theme of longing for an old lover. While Adele is apologetic, Tom Waits confesses that he is still in love with Martha. We can also see that Waits is aware of the well being of Martha but Adele doesn’t know much about her old flame. Also this is not the first time that Adele is calling him and we know that her calls are being ignored.</p> <h2>'we'</h2> <img class=center-block src=./images/word_trees/ad_tree_we.74a8a996.png> <img class=center-block src=./images/word_trees/tw_tree_we.7cbec9f6.png> <p>They are both longing for their younger days. While TW admits that they have matured with time, Adele is someplace else (‘other side’) dreaming about her past.</p> <h2>'I'</h2> <img class=center-block src=./images/word_trees/ad_tree_I.2dbccfe2.png> <img class=center-block src=./images/word_trees/tw_tree_I.61f2901d.png> <p>We see a theme of having wronged their lover</p> <h2>'hello'</h2> <img class=center-block src=./images/word_trees/ad_tree_hello.5cc17e07.png> <img class=center-block src=./images/word_trees/tw_tree_is.9a604f37.png> <p>If it wasn't clear yet, both are making a phone call. Adele talks about being on the other side which could refer to having become successful or having left their old town</p> </section> <section class=conclusion> <h1>Conclusion</h1> <p>Both songs touch common themes of calling an ex, reminiscing about younger days, having wronged their lover and being apologetic. While Tom Waits is still hasn’t gotten over his lover Adele seems to be in need of reconciliation and perhaps longs for forgiveness. The songs share a lot of thematic similarities but the vocabulary used and the structure of the lyrics is quite different. I hope this data visualization restates that one song is not a copy of the other and the following quote by Greg Kurstin (co-writer/composer of Hello) clearly states that they were heavily influenced by the honesty in Tom Waits’ writing style. </p> <blockquote> <p>She didn’t want to just go through and write a pop song with any particular formula. We talked about Tom Waits, and different storytellers like that. I think that was the idea, that we wanted to do something that was very honest about where she was at right now, and she wanted to do something that was real and believable. </p> <small>Greg Kurstin <cite>(co-author/co-producer of Hello)</cite> </small> </blockquote> </section> </div> <!-- <div class="row marketing">
